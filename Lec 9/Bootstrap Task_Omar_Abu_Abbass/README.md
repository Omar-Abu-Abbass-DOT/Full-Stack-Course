# 🛍️ Bootstrap Product Store

## 📌 Project Overview
A responsive e-commerce homepage layout built using the **Bootstrap 5** framework. This project demonstrates the ability to rapidly prototype modern web interfaces using Bootstrap's utility classes, grid system, and pre-built components (Navbar, Cards, Jumbotron) with minimal custom CSS.

    * **Desktop:** 4 products per row.
    * **Tablet:** 2 products per row.
    * **Mobile:** 1 product per row.
* **Product Cards:** Styled using Bootstrap Cards with shadow effects, rounded corners, and "Buy Now" buttons.
* **Interactive Elements:** Custom hover effects on product cards for better user experience.
* **Footer:** A clean, dark-themed footer with copyright information.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic markup structure.
