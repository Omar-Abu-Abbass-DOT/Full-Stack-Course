# Bootstrap Admin Dashboard

## Project Overview
A professional, responsive admin dashboard layout built using the **Bootstrap 5** framework. This project demonstrates mastery of the Bootstrap Grid System, creating a complex layout with a sidebar, statistical cards, and responsive data tables without writing any custom CSS.

## Key Features
* **Advanced Grid Layout:** Utilizes `col-lg-3` for the sidebar and `col-lg-9` for the main content, ensuring a perfect split on desktop and stacking on mobile.
* **Responsive Sidebar:** A navigation menu built with Bootstrap List Groups that adapts smoothly to small screens.
* **Statistics Section:** Key metrics displayed in responsive Cards, featuring:
    * Status Badges (New, Pending, Done).
    * Rounded Pill styling (Bonus Feature).
* **Data Management Table:** A rich user table featuring:
    * `table-responsive` wrapper for mobile scrolling.
    * `table-striped` and `table-hover` for readability.
    * **Dark Header** theme (Bonus Feature).
    * Color-coded badges for user status (Active/Inactive).
* **Top Navigation:** A dark-themed Navbar for branding and user profile access (Bonus Feature).

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** Semantic markup structure.
* **Bootstrap 5 (CDN):** Core framework for layout, typography, and components.
* **Font Awesome:** For dashboard icons (Users, Charts, Settings).
