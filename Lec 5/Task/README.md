Dot Coffee Shop - Landing Page

 Project Overview:
This project is a single-page landing page designed for Dot Coffee Shop. It demonstrates a responsive web design layout using semantic HTML5 and advanced CSS3 styling techniques. The goal was to create an engaging user interface that effectively highlights the brand's products and encourages user interaction.

 Key Features:
* Sticky Navigation Bar: A fixed header that stays at the top of the viewport for easy navigation.
* Hero Section: Features a large background image, a slogan, and a strategically positioned "Order Now" button using absolute positioning.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes:
    * Desktop: Full horizontal layout.
    * Tablet (<900px): Adjusted font sizes and spacing.
    * Mobile (<600px): Stacked layout for better readability on small screens.
* Interactive Elements: Hover effects on buttons and links, plus a floating "Daily Deal" button.
* Z-index Management: Ensures proper layering of text and buttons over background images.

 Technologies Used:
* HTML5: Semantic structure (<header>, <nav>, <section>, <footer>).
* CSS3: Flexbox, Positioning (Absolute, Relative, Sticky, Fixed), Media Queries.
